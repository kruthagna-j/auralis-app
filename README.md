# Auralis

A free, privacy-first music player for Android (with Windows and Linux builds available from the same source).

## Build the Android APK

No local setup is needed — GitHub builds it for you:

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Open the **Actions** tab → **Build Auralis APK** → wait for the green tick.
3. Download the `auralis-apk` artifact and install `app-arm64-v8a-debug.apk` on your phone.

To build locally instead: install Flutter, then run `flutter pub get` and `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`.

## Before you publish releases

Links inside the app (About page, share text, update checker) point to
`https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/auralis-app`. Replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME`
with your GitHub username. In PowerShell, from the project folder:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -File -Include *.dart,*.json,*.md | ForEach-Object {
  (Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw) -replace 'YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME','your-real-username' | Set-Content $_.FullName -NoNewline
}
```
